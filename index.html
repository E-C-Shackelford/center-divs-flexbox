          I am a visual artist and apsiring front-end developer and visual
          designer based in Portland, Oregon. I received my Bachelor of Arts in
          Interdisciplinary Studies from Marylhurst University in 2011 and the
          concentration of my B.A. was self-designed, primarily incorporating
          fine art and psychology. As a visual artist, I specialize in oil-based
          colored pencil and graphite, and my work primarily centers around pet,
          animal and human portraiture; female empowerment; inner magic; and
          imaginative realism.

          I am passionate about creativity and movement! I love creating visual
          art, spending time out in nature, plants and gardening, running,
          fitness, music, reading, and learning about front-end development and
          visual design.

          My passion for creativity, visual communication, the arts,
          interdisciplinary studies, creative problem solving; the relationship
          between art, people, communication, and technology; and my fascination
          with the ways in which technology expands the landscape of creativity,
          innovation, and communication, led me to not only becoming a visual
          artist, but to also pursuing my studies in front-end development,
          visual design, and user experience design.
